## Schematic

The schematic for the Launchpad Controller can be found in [doc/schematics/s chematic.pdf](schematics/schematic.pdf)

## Connectors

### Inputs

- 2x XT60 battery input for 3S LiPos (11.1V nominal). On top of the above picture
- 1x 5V regulated input. Use the USB connector on the microcontroller OR the 5.2V connector at the bottom of the above picture

### Outputs

- 3x JST-XH, 3 pins with PWM signal
- 2x XT30 female @12V ON/OFF
- 2x XT30 female @24V ON/OFF
- 1x XT30 female @12V or @24V, output of an H-bridge (2 more H-bridge outputs can be added)

## Controls

### Solenoid control

- Up to 4 at a time. 2 at 12V and 2 at 24V
- Any solenoid can draw up to 15A

### Servo Control

- Up to 3 at a time
- 6V/0.5A
- 50 Hz PWM signal with adjustable duty cycle

### H-bridge

- Up to 3 outputs at a time
- 12V or 24V. Selectable with a jumper on the bottom side of the PCB

## Communication

A computer can control the Launchpad Controller through the USB Serial interface of the microcontroller or through a LoRa transceiver (RFM9xW). There is a 50Î© RP-SMA connector to connect an antenna
